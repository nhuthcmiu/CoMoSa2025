 <h4><strong>Transportation</strong></h4>

  <h5 style="color:#3498db"><strong>From Hanoi Airport - Noi Bai International Airport (Code: HAN)</strong></h5>
  <p>Located 45km from the city center, Hanoi Airport is the largest in Vietnam. Also known as Noi Bai, it has two terminals: an older one for domestic travel and an international terminal completed in 2014.</p>
  <p>Public transportation, taxis and car rental services can be found at the arrivals area.</p>

  <h5 style="color:#3498db"><strong>Bus Express 86</strong></h5>
  <p>You can wait at the bus stop near Terminal 1 and 2 and get on Express 86. Then, you should get off at 56 Ly Thuong Kiet, where Melia is located.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Price:</strong> 1$ - 2$</li>
    <li><strong>Frequency of operation:</strong> 25-30 minutes/trip</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 style="color:#3498db"><strong>Airport Taxi</strong></h5>
  <p>Fast-paced on the surface, the true rhythm of Hanoi life is far from hurried and is reflected well in its leisurely coffee hours. Alongside traditional coffee houses, an ever-growing band of unique cafes serve new brews in cool caffeine dens.</p>

  <h5 style="color:#3498db"><strong>Grabcar</strong></h5>
  <p>Located in an area rich in clay, the village has the advantage of ingredients to create fine ceramics. Lying beside the Red River, between Thang Long and Pho Hien—two ancient trade centers in the north of Vietnam during the 15th–17th century—Bat Trang’s ceramics were favorite products not only in the domestic market but also in foreign ones.</p>
